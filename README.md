# hustletracker 3000

hustle-tracker-3000 is a simple Rails application for tracking ones personal hustles. Its structure is vaguely inspired by JIRA's model of individual tasks with time estimations, but places a bigger emphasis on organizing those tasks into projects and tracking, rather than prescribing, the amount of time spent on each one.
